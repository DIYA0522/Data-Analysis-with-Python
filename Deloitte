Macora Industries -- face an issue --interruptions in assembly line.
They need to know the cause.
They have a large amount of data from their factories fetched using industrial Internet of Things.
 Now we need to create a dashboard using Tableau.
The goal is to create visualisations that will help you understand the data, uncover the patterns
and identify the key issues impacting their operations
Through this we help Macora understand where the major disruptions are happening and why.

Take your time to understand the data, 
think critically 
and using Tableau highlight the most important insights.
This task is all about problem solving.

This will help Macora improve their manufacturing process.


Telemetry data - automatic collection and transmission of data from remote sources (machines, devices, sensors, etc.) to a central system for monitoring and analysis.
Data unification algorithm - since data is from diff sources, the structure, and naming conventions are usually inconsistent. the process of turning messy, heterogeneous 
input into a clean, consistent dataset.


Each location has 9 types of machines, sending message every 10 mins, they've collected data of 1 months and shared it in the form of a single json file.

The reason the client wanted to collect telemetry was to answer 2 questions:

1.In which location did machines break the most?
2.What are the machines that broke most often in that location?
