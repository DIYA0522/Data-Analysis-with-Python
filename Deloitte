Macora Industries -- face an issue --interruptions in assembly line.
They need to know the cause.
They have a large amount of data from their factories fetched using industrial Internet of Things.
 Now we need to create a dashboard using Tableau.
The goal is to create visualisations that will help you understand the data, uncover the patterns
and identify the key issues impacting their operations
Through this we help Macora understand where the major disruptions are happening and why.

Take your time to understand the data, 
think critically 
and using Tableau highlight the most important insights.
This task is all about problem solving.

This will help Macora improve their manufacturing process.
